Koala  was made by Tea Cup & SxR#3550 And Koala's website [Here](https://koala.glitch.me/) was made by Sup3rFir3r#1633.
Our hope in Koala is to have an customiziable bot that is cool & fun at the same time!
I started Koala in June as an secrete project but then i need some friends to join so i invited the 2 to help out:)
